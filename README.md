# WeberBrain 678 App Specification

## 1. Introduction

WeberBrain 678 is a Flutter-based mobile application that control 678 device. This specification outlines the architecture, design patterns, and best practices to be followed during the development and maintenance of the app.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The app follows a feature-based Clean Architecture approach, which promotes separation of concerns and maintainability. The architecture is divided into the following layers:

- Presentation Layer
- Domain Layer
- Data Layer

### 2.1 Folder Structure

```
lib/
  ├── config/
  ├── core/
  ├── features/
  │   ├── feature1/
  │   │   ├── data/
  │   │   ├── domain/
  │   │   └── presentation/
  │   ├── feature2/
  │   └── ...
  └── main.dart
```

### 2.2 Layer Responsibilities

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI and user interactions. Contains Widgets, Pages, and BLoCs.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and use cases. Defines repository interfaces and entities.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data sources and implements repositories. Handles API calls and local storage.

## 3. Design Patterns and State Management

### 3.1 BLoC Pattern

The app uses the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management. BLoCs act as an intermediate layer between the UI and the data layer, managing the app's state and business logic.

#### Best Practices:

- Keep BLoCs focused on a single feature or screen.
- Use events to trigger state changes and states to represent the UI state.
- Avoid putting navigation logic in BLoCs.

### 3.2 Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern is used to abstract the data sources from the rest of the app. Repositories act as a single source of truth for data.

#### Best Practices:

- Define repository interfaces in the domain layer.
- Implement repositories in the data layer.
- Use repositories to handle data caching and decide between local and remote data sources.

### 3.3 Dependency Injection

The app uses the `get_it` package for dependency injection, following the Service Locator pattern.

#### Best Practices:

- Register dependencies in the `injection_container.dart` file.
- Use factory registration for objects that should be recreated on each use (e.g., BLoCs).
- Use singleton registration for objects that should persist throughout the app's lifecycle (e.g., repositories, API clients).

## 4. Routing and Navigation

### 4.1 AutoRoute

The app uses the `auto_route` package for declarative routing.

#### Best Practices:

- Define all routes in the `app_router.dart` file.
- Use the `@RoutePage()` annotation for all routable pages.
- Generate route files using `build_runner`.

## 5. API Integration and Networking

### 5.1 Dio and Retrofit

Use Dio for HTTP requests and Retrofit for type-safe API calls.

#### Best Practices:

- Create an API client for each feature or group of related endpoints.
- Use Retrofit annotations to define API methods.
- Handle network errors consistently across the app.

## 6. Local Storage

### 6.1 SharedPreferences

Use SharedPreferences for storing small amounts of data locally.

#### Best Practices:

- Create a wrapper class for SharedPreferences to centralize access and provide type-safe methods.
- Use SharedPreferences for user settings and small cache items.

### 6.2 Hive (Optional)

For more complex local storage needs, consider using Hive.

#### Best Practices:

- Define type adapters for complex objects.
- Use boxes to organize different types of data.

## 7. Asynchronous Programming

### 7.1 Futures and Streams

Use Futures for single asynchronous operations and Streams for continuous data flows.

#### Best Practices:

- Use `async`/`await` syntax for cleaner asynchronous code.
- Handle errors using try-catch blocks or `.catchError()`.
- Use StreamBuilders for UI components that depend on streams of data.

## 8. Error Handling and Logging

### 8.1 Error Handling

Implement a centralized error handling mechanism.

#### Best Practices:

- Create custom exception classes for different types of errors.
- Use a global error handler to catch and log unhandled exceptions.
- Display user-friendly error messages in the UI.

### 8.2 Logging

Use the `logger` package for consistent logging throughout the app.

#### Best Practices:

- Create a centralized logging service.
- Use different log levels (debug, info, warning, error) appropriately.
- Avoid logging sensitive information.

## 9. Testing

### 9.1 Unit Tests

Write unit tests for business logic, BLoCs, and repositories.

#### Best Practices:

- Aim for high test coverage in the domain and data layers.
- Use mocking to isolate units of code during testing.
- Run tests before each commit and in CI/CD pipelines.

### 9.2 Widget Tests

Write widget tests for important UI components.

#### Best Practices:

- Test widget rendering and user interactions.
- Use `WidgetTester` to interact with widgets in tests.

### 9.3 Integration Tests

Write integration tests for critical user flows.

#### Best Practices:

- Test the interaction between different parts of the app.
- Use `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding` for integration tests.

## 10. Performance Optimization

### 10.1 Widget Optimization

Optimize widget rebuilds and rendering.

#### Best Practices:

- Use `const` constructors where possible.
- Implement `equatable` for value equality in classes used in BLoCs.
- Use `RepaintBoundary` for complex UI components that don't change often.

### 10.2 Memory Management

Manage app memory efficiently.

#### Best Practices:

- Dispose of controllers, animations, and stream subscriptions when no longer needed.
- Use weak references for cache implementations to allow garbage collection.

## 11. Internationalization

Use the `intl` package for internationalization.

#### Best Practices:

- Externalize all user-facing strings.
- Use the `Intl.message()` function for translatable strings.
- Generate `intl_*.arb` files for translations.

## 12. Accessibility

Ensure the app is accessible to all users.

#### Best Practices:

- Use semantic labels for all interactive elements.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast.
- Support screen readers by providing meaningful descriptions.

## 13. Code Style and Linting

Follow the official Dart style guide and use `flutter_lints` package.

#### Best Practices:

- Run `flutter analyze` regularly and fix any issues.
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables and methods, PascalCase for classes).
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility.

## 14. Version Control and Collaboration

### 14.1 Git Workflow

Use Git for version control and follow a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).

#### Best Practices:

- Create feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
- Use pull requests for code reviews before merging into the main branch.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.

### 14.2 Documentation

Maintain up-to-date documentation.

#### Best Practices:

- Use comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.
- Keep the README file updated with setup instructions and important information.
- Document APIs and public methods using dartdoc comments.

## 15. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

#### Best Practices:

- Run tests automatically on each pull request.
- Use code coverage tools to ensure adequate test coverage.
- Automate the build and release process for different environments (dev, staging, production).

## Conclusion

This specification provides a comprehensive guide for developing and maintaining the WeberBrain 678 app. By following these guidelines, the development team can ensure consistency, maintainability, and high quality throughout the project. Regular reviews and updates to this specification are recommended as the project evolves.
